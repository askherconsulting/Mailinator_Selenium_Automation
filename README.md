# C-_Selenium_Automation_Mailinator

This code repo was built from Carlos Kidman's excellent Test Automation University course on C# Selenium Automation.  Due to time constrains, it does not have all of the features described in that project (yet!).

The purpose of this framework is to accompany the Mailinator Selenium Tutorial YouTube video, where I show how to automate your end to end sign up process using Mailinator.

In this repo you will find examples of the following:-

* Using a private mailinator inbox to click links in sign up authentication via email
* Using a public mailinator inbox to click links in sign up authentication via email
* Using iFrames to interact with Emails in Mailinator
* Generating a random email and password to use in your test data
